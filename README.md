# Notes

This repo contains random university notes.

All the notes are written in Markdown using Obsidian (https://obsidian.md/)
that's why some parts of the files are not rendered correctly by github :(.

If you plan on using Obsidian to read the notes I suggest to use the *reading mode* available inside the application that can be activated by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd + e` on the keyboard, or by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd + p` and searching for *reading mode*.
